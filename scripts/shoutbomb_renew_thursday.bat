::  PURPOSE
::
::  This script provides patron account notification information to the Shoutbomb Voice and Text notification service.
::  1.  The script retrieves hold, overdue, and renew notification information from the Polaris ILS database using 
::      sqlcmd and external sql scripts. It writes the query results to a pipe (|) delimited text files.
::  2.  The script uploads the files to Shoutbomb's FTP server using the WinSCP program for Microsoft Windows.
::      The WinSCP activity is written to a log file.
::  3.  The script moves the query results file to a backup folder and appends the date and time to the filename.
::
::  PARAMETERS
::
::  The script accepts 1 parameter based on the information requested.  The options are holds, overdue, renew,
::  voice_patrons, and text_patrons.  These terms are used for any folder, file, or script names related to the specific

::  text_patrons are lists of patrons who have selected phone or texting as their primary notification method.
::
